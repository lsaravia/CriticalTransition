# The critical transition between neutral and competitive communities 

## Calculation of the critical point using the probability of spanning cluster

I use here the following neutral model with power dispersal kernel:
en el $p_c$ 
<https://github.com/lsaravia/Neutral>

I generate parameter files for the simulation of neutral/hierarchical model using a uniform and a logseries metacommunity distribution  


```{r setup, eval=T }
load(".RData")

oldcd <-getwd()
source("R/Neutral_fun.r")

# Set the location of the binary 
#
neuBin <- "~/Dropbox/cpp/CaNew/Neutral/ipsNeutralPow"
neuBin64<- "~/Dropbox/cpp/CaNew/Neutral/ipsNeutralP64"

# Determination of the critical point using probability of spanning cluster

## Simulations for Uniform and Logseries side =128,192,256 species=64 1T=20000 


The critical probability is very low around 0.0005 thus most communities should be in a "niche" state but the transient time is very long unless rho is relatively high.

## Calculation of the Suvival Time of the most abundant species (Species=1) and density for side=512 time=5000 uniform metacomunity   (NOT DONE)

Survival of 1 = P(t) ~ t ^-delta
Number of 1 = N(t) ~ t^theta

To do this the model should be non saturated !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
